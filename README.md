# Angular2 with Typescript, NodeJs with ExpressJs and Sequalize ORM with PostgreSQL
In this example I created Demo application to show how to implement server and client side application to do CRUD operations for one DB table called DogeFriends.

## Environment setup
1. Install NodeJs from https://nodejs.org/
2. Install PostgreSQL from http://www.postgresql.org/
3. Clone repository to your local mashine
4. Run Npm install `npm install`
5. Run gulp start-server to start server side application with WEB API `gulp start-server`
6. Run gulp start-client to start client side angular2 application `gulp start-client`

Recommened IDE is Visual Studio Community because it have best integration with Typescript compilation. This is also my prefered IDE as a .NET developer.

## Technologies used for this project

### Typescript
TypeScript is a free and open source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to the language. TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. <br/>

### Angular2
Angular2 is WEB applications developments framework which allow to create robust WEB applications. <br/>

### NodeJs
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side web applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, Linux. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world. <br/>

### ExpressJs
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node features that you know and love. <br/>

### Sequalize ORM
Sequelize is a promise-based ORM for Node.js and io.js. It supports the dialects PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and MSSQL and features solid transaction support, relations, read replication and more. <br/>

### PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL, often simply Postgres, is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and on standards-compliance. As a database server, its primary function is to store data securely, supporting best practices, and to allow for retrieval at the request of other software applications. It can handle workloads ranging from small single-machine applications to large Internet-facing applications with many concurrent users. <br/>
